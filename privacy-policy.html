  <h1>Privacy Policy - Desktop Uploader</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19 June 2025</p>

  <h3>1. Who we are</h3>
  <p>Desktop Uploader (“the App”) is a desktop tool that helps creators send finished MP4 files to their TikTok <em>Drafts</em> folder for later publishing.</p>

  <h3>2. Data we collect</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>OAuth tokens for TikTok – stored only on your device, never on our servers.</li>
    <li>Video files and metadata you explicitly choose to upload.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. How we use data</h3>
  <p>Tokens authorise uploads; video files are transmitted only to official platform APIs. We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share your data.</p>

  <h3>4. Third-party services</h3>
  <p>TikTok Content Posting API</p>

  <h3>5. Security</h3>
  <p>All API calls use HTTPS. Tokens are encrypted via your OS keychain (Keychain on macOS, DPAPI on Windows).</p>

  <h3>6. Your rights</h3>
  <p>You may revoke platform access at any time in the App or in platform security settings. Delete local data by removing the App’s config folder.</p>

  <h3>7. Changes</h3>
  <p>We will update this page for any future changes. Continuing to use the App after an update constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>
