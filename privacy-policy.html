    <h1>Privacy Policy – Desktop Uploader</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: 19 June 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>The Desktop Uploader is a tool that helps creators upload videos directly to their TikTok profiles through TikTok's official API.</p>

    <h2>2. Data we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>OAuth tokens for TikTok – stored only on your device, never on our servers.</li>
      <li>Video files and metadata that you explicitly choose to upload.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How we use data</h2>
    <p>We use OAuth tokens solely to authorize uploads to TikTok. All videos and metadata are sent directly to TikTok via their official Content Posting API. We do <strong>not</strong> sell, share, or store your data on any external servers.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>This app integrates exclusively with the TikTok Content Posting API for direct content publishing.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>All API requests use secure HTTPS connections. OAuth tokens are encrypted using your operating system’s secure keychain (e.g., Keychain on macOS or DPAPI on Windows).</p>

    <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
    <p>You may revoke TikTok access tokens at any time via the app or your TikTok security settings. You may also delete all local data by removing the app’s configuration files.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy at any time. Continued use of the app after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
